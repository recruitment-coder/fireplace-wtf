Ground rules (both variants)
Plain HTML, CSS (or SCSS) and modern JavaScript (ES6+). No UI frameworks (no React, Vue, Angular, Svelte). Ads have to load fast and run everywhere.
Allowed libraries: GSAP for animation. For Variant A you may also use Phaser or write the game on a plain <canvas> or DOM, your choice. A bundler (Vite, webpack, esbuild) is optional. Opening index.html through a local server is enough.
Use the provided assets. All images are exported at 2x, so render them at 50% of their pixel size. Don't redraw or replace them. Positions should match the design files as closely as you can measure them, not "by eye".
Clickout: every CTA must open the landing page in a new window through a click tag:
const clickTag = window.clickTag || 'https://example.com/landing';
Weight: keep the total ad (all files you ship) under 3 MB. Compress assets if you need to, and tell us what you did.
AI tools are welcome. We work AI-first every day (Claude Code, Playwright). Use whatever you like, but you must understand and be able to explain every line you submit. Tell us briefly how you used AI and where you had to correct it.
Confidentiality: the assets are adapted from real campaigns, with logos and packaging replaced by placeholders, and are shared with you only for this exercise. Please use them only for this task.

Variant B: Fireplace Ad
A desktop "fireplace" skin for a cough and cold campaign: a top banner plus a left and a right skyscraper that frame the publisher's website. No interaction is planned besides the clickout. The goal is that it is beautifully animated.

Files: variant-b-fireplace/

design/layout.png: target layout of all three parts
assets/top/, assets/left/, assets/right/: background, headline, logo layers for each part (2x)
assets/box.png (text panel), assets/cta.png (button), assets/bg-big.jpg (one continuous background for the whole fireplace)
Format: three separate creatives that run side by side, built from 2x assets:

Top: 1032x250 CSS px (assets 2064x500)
Left and Right: 320x975 CSS px (assets 640x1950)
Build each part as its own HTML file (top.html, left.html, right.html) because in production they are delivered as three separate ads. Add a preview.html that places the three parts (e.g. in iframes) like in design/layout.png, with an empty area in the middle where the website would be.

Required behaviour

Pixel-accurate layout matching design/layout.png: logo, product, text panel, copy and CTA in the right place and size on each skyscraper; three-line headline on the top banner.
Continuous background: the moss background must look like one surface across all three parts. When they sit next to each other, the seams should line up. bg-big.jpg is provided for this, the per-part bg.jpg files are pre-cut versions. Decide which approach you use and explain why.
Intro animation (roughly 3 to 6 seconds), coordinated across the three parts. For example: background slowly zooms in, logos fade/scale in, product slides in and eases to a stop, text panel and copy reveal, headline on the top banner builds line by line, CTA appears last.
After the intro, keep it alive but calm: e.g. a subtle background zoom or drift and a gentle CTA pulse. It must not distract from the website content. Stop or reduce looping animation after about 30 seconds.
Clickout: clicking anywhere on a part (or at least on the CTA) opens the click tag.
Performance: animations should run smoothly on an average laptop. Animate transform and opacity, not layout properties. Respect prefers-reduced-motion (show the final state without motion).
Nice to have: the three parts start their animation in sync even though they are separate documents (e.g. via postMessage from the preview page); a debug overlay that shows the design layout at 50% opacity on top of your build so you can check alignment.

Deliverables (both variants)
A new public GitHub repository. Do not fork this repository: create your own and copy the files you need. Send us the link in a reply to the email with this task. We read the commit history, so commit as you go rather than one big final commit.
README.md with:
how to run it locally (one or two commands at most),
what you would do next with more time,
any known issues or shortcuts you took.
DECISIONS.md: a short decision log (bullet points are fine). Examples: how you scaled the ad to the viewport, how you did collision / how you aligned the background, how you handled audio, why you picked canvas vs DOM, what you compressed.
AI note (a few sentences, in the README is fine): which tools you used, for what, and one example where the output was wrong and you fixed it.
Optional: a short screen recording (under 1 minute).
Everything you submit must be stored in the repository, including the optional recording.
